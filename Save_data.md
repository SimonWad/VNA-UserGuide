# Saving data files on external USB

The main apeal of the VNA is capturing data for your projects. So this guide wil focus on saving to an external USB as this is the easiest way of getting data from device to device.

The Ascociated USB contains a **user guide** that is handy for exploring the features of the FieldFox.

> **Notice:** the guide is for N99xxA, meaning that not everything mentioned in the PDF is applicable to our device, the **FieldFox N9951A**.

If anything is unclear please refer to the user guide or the offical documentation.

## CSV data to USB
